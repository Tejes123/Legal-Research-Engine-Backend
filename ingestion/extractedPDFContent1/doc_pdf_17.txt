JUDGMENT
 
This is a plaintiff's appeal calling in question the 
order 
dated 
08.06.2021 
passed 
in 
Com.O.S. 
No.8060/2018 whereunder interlocutory application 
filed under Order 39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC seeking an ad 
interim order of temporary injunction to restrain the 
defendant, its agents, representatives, assignees or 
anybody claiming through or under them from violating 
non compete Clause 20.3 as per the Franchise 
Agreement dated 14.10.2017 by selling the products 
directly or indirectly in any manner or capacity 
whatsoever and compete with the franchise business, 
which is the subject matter of agreement.  
3
 
2. 
Plaintiff herein has filed a suit claiming 
damages for a sum of Rs.3,18,93,727/- with current and 
future interest @ 15% from the date of filing of suit till 
date of realization; to restrain the defendant or its 
agents, representatives from violating non compete 
Clause 20.3 of Franchise Agreement dated 14.10.2017.   
It is contended in the suit that defendant had 
approached the plaintiff by exhibiting its interest in 
promoting the designer clothes of the plaintiff in the 
market and as such a Franchise Agreement was entered 
between them on 14.10.2017 and on the understanding 
arrived between parties that they shall act in accordance 
with the standards of trademark "Jyoti Sachdev Iyer", a 
retail premises located at Ulsoor Road, Bangalore was 
taken on rent and interior design was done by the 
plaintiff's sister without charging for the same; it is 
further contended that defendant agreed to the terms 
and conditions mentioned in the Franchise Agreement, 
which was for a period of three (3) years; alleging that 
defendant 
has 
not 
conducted 
the 
business 
in 
accordance with agreement and has violated majority of 
4
the clauses without a second thought and despite giving 
several opportunities to the defendant to set-right its 
mistakes, defendant did not comply with the terms of 
the agreement but had issued a termination notice dated 
01.06.2018 terminating the Franchise Agreement and as 
such alleging violation of Clause 19.3, a suit came to be 
filed by the plaintiff.  It was further contended that 
defendant is liable to pay a sum of Rs.4,00,000/- 
towards payment held by the defendant and apart from 
sales receivable, a sum of Rs.1,89,96,000/- is payable 
as compensation for unexpired period of two (2) years 
four (4) months in terms of Clause 20.5 and in-toto a 
sum of Rs.3,18,93,727/- is payable by the defendant to 
plaintiff towards settlement of account in lieu of 
termination made by the defendant including damages.  
It is further contended that defendant had continued to 
violate Clause 20.3 under which defendant had agreed 
not to carry on business of similar nature or in any 
manner whatsoever similar to that of plaintiff for a 
period of two (2) years on completion of period 
prescribed 
under 
Franchise 
Agreement 
and 
yet 
5
defendant had continued to brazenly violate the said 
clause.  Hence, permanent injunction was sought for.  
 
3. 
In aid of main relief, as already noticed 
hereinabove, an interlocutory application under Order 
39 Rule 1 and 2 CPC was filed for grant of injunction.  
Said application was resisted to by the defendant by 
filing objections.  Learned trial Judge after considering 
the rival contentions and on perusal of pleadings has 
arrived at a conclusion that though Clause 20.3 of the 
Franchise Agreement contains a non compete clause, on 
the premise that negative covenant of the agreement 
operates beyond the term of contract held as void and 
not permissible by referring to Section 27 of the Contract 
Act, rejected the said application.  Hence, this appeal.  
 
4. 
We have heard Smt. Revathi Adinatha Narde, 
learned counsel appearing on behalf of appellant.  It is 
her contention that defendant has not only brazenly 
violated the non compete clause 20.3 of the Franchise 
Agreement, but has also violated the exparte order of 
temporary 
injunction 
granted 
and 
as 
such 
an 
6
application under Order 39 Rule 2A CPC has been filed 
against defendant.  She further contends that trial court 
committed a serious error in rejecting the said 
application, in as much as, non compete Clause 20.3 of 
Franchise 
Agreement 
is 
enforceable 
against 
the 
defendant whereunder she has clearly agreed that she 
would not carry on similar business as that of the 
plaintiff even after a period of two (2) years even after 
expiration of agreement period and as such defendant is 
required to be restrained from carrying on the business 
till 14.10.2022.  
 
5. 
Having heard the learned Advocate appearing 
for appellant and on perusal of pleadings as laid before 
trial judge and order under challenge in this appeal, it 
requires to be noticed that for grant of temporary 
injunction the plaintiff has to necessarily establish three 
(3) ingredients namely, prima facie case, balance of 
convenience and irreparable loss and injury being 
caused in the event of temporary injunction being 
refused. 
7
 
6. 
It is trite law that where the plaintiff can be 
suitably compensated in terms of money no order of 
temporary injunction would be granted.  In the instant 
case, as noticed hereinabove, learned trial Judge has 
opined that Clause 20.3, which is a non compete clause 
which has been pressed into service by the plaintiff 
seeking for a order of restraint against defendant, is hit 
by Section 27 of the Contract Act namely, a restrictive 
covenant extending beyond the term of the contract is 
void and unenforceable.  Without expressing any opinion 
in that regard for a moment, when the case of plaintiff is 
examined in the background of Clause 20.3 of the 
Franchise Agreement dated 14.10.2017, it would clearly 
indicate that defendant would not be entitled to carry on 
similar business for a period of two (2) years i.e., on the 
expiry of agreement or termination of the agreement.  In 
the instant case, even according to plaintiff the 
defendant has terminated the Franchise Agreement 
dated 14.10.2017 by issuance of termination notice 
dated 01.06.2018.  Thus, non compete clause assuming 
for  a moment is enforceable against the defendant 
8
would only be for a period of two (2) years i.e., upto 
01.06.2020.  Beyond the said period plaintiff would not 
be entitled to seek for an order of temporary injunction 
to restrain the defendant from carrying on the business 
similar to the business carried on by the plaintiff.  In 
other words, prayer of the plaintiff has got spent itself.   
 
7. 
As such we are of the considered view that 
trial court was justified in arriving at a conclusion that 
there is no prima facie case in favour of plaintiff.  That 
apart, by refusing to grant order of temporary injunction 
trial court has also taken note of the fact that claim of 
plaintiff is for award of damages and if at all if the 
defendant has sold any product of the plaintiff during 
the operation of exparte order of temporary injunction, it 
would be always open for the plaintiff to pursue their 
claim which is said to have been already initiated in the 
pending suit and we are not expressing any opinion in 
this regard as matter is still at large before the trial 
court and particularly in the background of plaintiff 
having undisputedly filed an application under Order 39 
Rule 2A CPC and same is pending.  Hence, we are of the 
9
considered view that appeal is not required to be 
entertained.   
 
For the reasons aforestated, we proceed to pass the 
following:
