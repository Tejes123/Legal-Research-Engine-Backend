THIS COMAP IS FILED UNDER SECTION 13(A) OF THE 
COMMERCIAL COURTS ACT, 2015 PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE 
ORDER PASSED BY THE COMMERCIAL COURT (CCH 84) OF I.A. 
NO.1 IN COM.AA NO.7/2021 DATED 29.01.2021 BY ALLOWING 
THE ABOVE APPEAL. 
 
THIS COMAP COMING ON FOR HEARING THROUGH VIDEO 
CONFERENCING 
THIS 
DAY, 
CHIEF 
JUSTICE 
MADE 
THE 
FOLLOWING: 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
Heard 
the 
learned 
counsel 
appearing 
for 
the 
appellants.   
 
2. 
The appellants are the respondents in a petition filed 
by the respondent herein under Section 9 of the Arbitration 
and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, "the said Act of 
1996").  In the petition filed under Section 9 of the said Act 
of 1996, the respondent has contended that the appellants 
have not repaid the loan granted to them to the extent of 
Rs.99,75,465/- as on 14th July 2020.  It is stated in the 
petition that the arbitration clause has been already 
invoked by the respondent.   
 
 
 
 
- 3 - 
3. 
In the said petition under Section 9 of the said Act of 
1996, I.A No.1 for interim relief was filed by the respondent 
seeking interim custody of the schedule plant and 
machineries in possession of the appellants.  The impugned 
order is an exparte ad interim order directing the appellants 
to furnish a security for payment of Rs.99,75,465/- within a 
period of fifteen days, failing which the respondent shall be 
permitted to take interim custody of the machineries 
mentioned in the petition schedule from the appellants, if 
necessary, with the help of jurisdictional police and to keep 
the same in its safe custody till the next date. 
 
4. 
An order was passed by this Court on 8th March 2021 
staying the order passed by the Commercial Court 
permitting the respondent to take interim custody subject 
to various conditions including a condition of depositing 
Rs.10,00,000/- on or before 22nd March 2021.  The amount 
was not deposited.  Therefore, the order of stay dated 8th 
March 2021 stands vacated. 
 
5. 
The impugned order is an exparte ad-interim order  
passed pending the final disposal of I.A No.1 filed in the 
petition under Section 9 of the said Act of 1996.  Hence, the 
appellants can file a statement of objections to I.A No.1 and 
 
 
 
- 4 - 
apply for vacating the exparte order.  If the appellants 
succeed and I.A No.1 is rejected by the Commercial Court, 
the action of restitution may follow.   
 
6. 
Therefore, it is not necessary, at this stage, to 
interfere with the exparte ad-interim order passed by the 
Commercial Court.   
7. 
The appeal is disposed of subject to the observations 
made above. 
 
8. 
All the contentions of the parties on merits of the 
pending proceedings are kept open.
