THIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL COMING ON FOR ORDERS 
THIS DAY, SATISH CHANDRA SHARMA. J., DELIVERED THE 
FOLLOWING: 
 
JUDGMENT 
 
 
 
This Commercial Appeal is arising out of judgment 
dated 21.12.2019 passed by LXXXII Additional City Civil 
and 
Sessions 
Judge, 
Bangalore 
in 
Com. 
O.S. 
No.3343/1986 [M/s. Karamchand Thapar (Coal Sales) Ltd. 
Vs. Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd.]. 
 
2. 
The 
facts 
of 
the 
case 
reveal 
that 
the 
respondent / plaintiff before this Court has filed a recovery 
suit against the present defendant for a sum of 
Rs.1,64,74,147/- along with interest at the rate of 18% 
 
 
3 
 
 
  
per annum from the date of filing of the suit till realization.  
During the pendency of the suit, the appellant submitted 
before the Trial Court an affidavit stating that the present 
appellant / defendant is ready to pay a sum of 
Rs.53,59,711-31ps. along with interest at the rate of 12% 
per annum and keeping in view the affidavit filed by the 
present appellant, the suit was decreed holding that the 
plaintiff is entitled to recover a sum of Rs.53,59,711-31ps. 
along with interest at the rate of 12% per annum.  There 
was another claim of the plaintiff which was rejected by 
the Trial Court.  No cross appeal has been filed before this 
Court.  It is only the Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd., 
who has filed the present appeal being aggrieved in the 
matter (i) in respect of levy of interest at the rate of 12% 
per annum from the date of suit till realization of the entire 
amount; (ii) in declining the relief prayed by the 
Corporation to adjust the amount which was available in 
respect of some other contract.

3. 
Learned counsel for the appellant has argued 
before this Court that the rate of interest awarded in the 
present case is on the higher side and keeping in view 
Section 34 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 
(hereinafter referred to as ‘C.P.C.’ for short), the question 
of awarding interest more than 6% does not arise.  
Learned counsel has placed reliance upon a judgment 
delivered in the case of HYDER CONSULTING (UK) 
LIMITED V. GOVERNOR, STATE OF ORISSA reported in 
(2015) 2 SCC 189.  It was a case arising out of 
Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. 
 
4. 
On the other hand, learned Senior Counsel has 
placed reliance upon a judgment delivered in the case of 
RAMPUR FERTILISER LTD. V. VIGYAN CHEMICALS 
INDUSTRIES reported in (2009) 12 SCC 324.  It is 
contended that in the light of the aforesaid judgment the 
rate of interest should have been 15% in place of 12% 
awarded by the Trial Court.  He has also placed reliance 
upon the judgment delivered in the case of CLARIANT 
 
 
5 
 
 
  
INTERNATIONAL LTD. AND ANOTHER V. SECURITIES 
& EXCHANGE BOARD OF INDIA reported in (2004)8 
SCC 524.  He has placed reliance upon paras 30, 35, 38, 
39, 43, 44 and 47 and his contention is that keeping in 
view the rates fixed by Reserve Bank of India, the plaintiff 
is certainly entitled for interest at the rate of 15% per 
annum.  He has also filed the Handbook of Monetary 
Statistics of India issued by Reserve Bank of India in the 
year 2006 which provides for rate of interest charged by 
State Bank of India right from 1970 to 2006 and the same 
reflects that at some point of time it was even 19% as rate 
of interest was fixed by State Bank of India.  It has prayed 
that 15% would have been appropriate in the peculiar 
facts and circumstances of the case. 
 
5. 
This Court has carefully gone through the 
judgments relied upon by the learned counsel for the 
parties and perused the record.  Section 34 of C.P.C. reads 
as under:  
         "34. INTEREST: - (1) Where and in so far as a 
decree is for the payment of money, the Court may, in 
 
 
6 
 
 
  
the decree, order interest at such rate as the Court 
deems reasonable to be paid on the principal sum 
adjudged, from the date of the suit to the date of the 
decree, in addition to any interest adjudged on such 
principal sum for any period prior to the institution of 
the suit, with further interest at such rate not 
exceeding six per cent per annum as the Court deems 
reasonable on such principal sum, from the date of the 
decree to the date of payment, or to such earlier date 
as the Court thinks fit. 
  
Provided that where the liability in relation to 
the sum so adjudged had arisen out of a commercial 
transaction, the rate of such further interest may 
exceed six per cent per annum, but shall not exceed 
the contractual rate of interest or where there is no 
contractual rate, the rate at which moneys are lent or 
advanced 
by 
nationalised 
banks 
in 
relation 
to 
commercial transactions. 
 
Explanation I:- In this Sub-section, "nationalised 
bank" means a corresponding new bank as defined in 
the Banking Companies (Acquisition and Transfer of 
Undertakings) Act, 1970 (5 of 1970). 
 
Explanation II:- For the purposes of this section, a 
transaction is a commercial transaction, if it is 
connected with the industry, trade or business of the 
party incurring the liability. 
 
 
 
7 
 
 
  
where such a decree is silent with respect to the 
payment of further interest on such principal sum from 
the date of the decree to the date of payment or other 
earlier date, the Court shall be deemed to have 
refused such interest, and a separate suit therefor 
shall not lie." 
 
6. 
In the considered opinion of this Court, 
keeping in view Section 34 of the C.P.C. and the judgment 
delivered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of 
RAMPUR FERTILISER LIMITED (supra) and the fact 
that the amount was with held by the defendant and the 
defendant on his own accepted the claim without there 
being any adjudication by the Commercial Court, the 
interest rate has to be fixed by taking into account various 
circumstances and the same has rightly been done by the 
trial Court.  The money due was wrongly with held and it is 
a pure case of contractual dispute between the parties, 
and therefore, keeping in view the totality of the 
circumstances of the case and the judgment delivered by 
the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the case of RAMPUR 
FERTILISER LIMITED (supra) as well as CLARIANT 
 
 
8 
 
 
  
INTERNATIONAL LTD. (supra), the Trial Court was 
having discretion to award interest at appropriate rate, 
keeping in view the facts and circumstances of the case.  
However, in the present case the most important aspect of 
the case is that the plaintiff himself while filing an affidavit 
in support of evidence in paragraph No.26 which relates to 
interest has stated on oath as under : 
"26. INTEREST  
As per the contract, the Final Bill had to be settled 
within a period of twelve months from the date of 
handing over the work. The work was completed and 
handed over to Defendant as long back as April 1983. 
Hence the final amounts due ought to have been 
settled before the end of April 1984. Plaintiff had 
undertaken this work as a commercial venture. They 
had tendered for the work on the assumption that 
amounts will be paid punctually as and when the 
amounts became due in terms of the contract. Plaintiff 
had invested huge amounts for the execution of the 
work and had borrowed heavily from Banks and 
Associated Companies for executing the work. If the 
Defendant has prepared and settled the Final Bill by 
the end of April 1984, in terms of the contract. Plaintiff 
could have discharged their liabilities, to that extent, 
to their Bankers and Associated Companies, thereby 
 
 
9 
 
 
  
saving payment of interest from April 1984. Having 
regard to the illegal and unauthorised retention of the 
amount's due without any justifiable cause and the 
loss that is being caused to the Plaintiff on account of 
the non-payment of the amounts due, it is submitted 
that Plaintiff is entitled to interest on the amounts due 
from 1-5-1984 upto the date of payment at 80% per 
annum, which is the normal rate of interest charged 
by the Nationalised Banks on commercial transactions.  
 
   However the Plaintiff has restricted its claim for 
interest at 9% p.a. on the amount due. The amount 
due by way of interest on Rs.1,36,49,824-01 Ps. from 
1-5-1984 to date of suit is Rs.56,48,645.99. Thus the 
total amount due to Plaintiff as on date for which this 
suit in filed is Rs.1,92,93,470/- is as follows:  
a) Amount due in regard to the 
work as per para 5.1 above 
 
Rs.1,36,49,824-01 
b) Interest thereon at 18% per 
annum from 1-5-1984 to 
date 
Rs.   28,24,322-50 
 
Total: 
Rs.1,64,73,146-50 
 
26. The Plaintiff had furnished a Bank Guarantee for 
Rs.7,00,000/- (No.31/72 dated 29-4-1972) issued by 
Oriental Bank of Commerce, Brabourne Road Branch, 
Calcutta, towards Security Deposit amount. Though 
the work was completed and handed over more than 
three years back before filing suit and though 
Defendant is due to Plaintiff in a heavy sum as 
aforesaid, the Defendant is still insisting and requiring 
 
 
10 
 
 
  
the Plaintiff to keep the said Bank Guarantee No.31/72 
dated 29-4-1972 extended, on the threat that unless it 
is extended, they would enforce the said guarantee. 
The work was completed as long back as April 1983 
and the question of Defendant having any security 
deposit or Bank Guarantee therefor, now, does not 
arise. 
To 
avoid 
enforcement, 
the 
Plaintiff 
was 
constrained to renew the said Bank Guarantee upto 
31st December 1986 and accordingly the Bank has 
issued 
letter 
of 
extension 
extending 
the 
said 
Guarantee 
upto 
31st 
December 
1986. 
Plaintiff 
apprehends that Defendant may enforce the said Bank 
Guarantee, if Plaintiff refuses to extend it any further. 
This Hon'ble Court has granted injunction against the 
Defendant and the same is in force and requires to be 
made absolute as prayed for." 
 
7. 
In the light of the aforesaid paragraph, it is 
crystal clear that plaintiff has restricted his claim for 
interest at the rate of 9% on the due amount.  The Trial 
Court has awarded interest at the rate of 12% per annum, 
and therefore, to that extent the rate of interest deserves 
to be reduced from 12% to 9% per annum. 
 
8. 
Resultantly, the present appeal is allowed.  The 
rate of interest awarded by the Trial Court is reduced from 
12% to 9% per annum.  A decree be drawn accordingly. 
 
 
11 
 
 
  
9. 
So far as the other relief of the plaintiff is 
concerned, 
for 
appropriating 
the 
amount 
which 
is 
outstanding in respect of the other contract keeping in 
view the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court in the 
case of M/s. LAKSHMICHAND AND BALCHAND V. 
STATE OF ANDHRA PRADESH reported in (1987) 1 SCC 
19 cannot be granted. The Hon'ble Supreme Court in 
almost identical situation keeping in view the doctrine of 
equitable set off has held that amount cannot be recovered 
from the contractor in respect of other contractor, and 
therefore, no relief can be granted and therefore, the 
prayer made by the appellant to that extent is rejected.
