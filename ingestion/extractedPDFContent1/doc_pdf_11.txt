      VIDE ORDER DATED 13.08.2021, NOTICE TO

***** 
 
 
THIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 13 
(1-A) OF THE COMMERCIAL COURTS ACT, 2016 READ WITH 
SECTION 37 OF THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 
1996 PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER DATED 17.06.2021 
PASSED ON I.A.NO.I IN COM.A.A.NO.65/2021 ON THE FILE OF 
LXXXVII ADDITIONAL CITY CIVIL AND SESSIONS JUDGE (CCH-
88), BENGALURU & ETC. 
 
THIS APPEAL COMING ON FOR ADMISSION, THIS DAY, 
ARAVIND KUMAR J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: 
 
 
 
 
6 
 
 
J U D G M E N T 
 
Defendant 
No.1 
in 
Com.AA.No.65/2021 
being 
aggrieved by the order dated 17.06.2021 passed in the 
said 
proceedings 
on 
IA.No.I 
whereunder 
appellant-
defendant No.1 and respondent No.17-defendant No.2, 
their directors, agents, servants, power of attorneys and 
managers etc. have been directed to maintain status-quo 
in respect of title and possession of property bearing 
Municipal No.10, PID No.68/244/10 which is morefully 
described in the interlocutory application (Annexure-C) are 
before this Court.   
 
2. This Court while issuing notice to respondents had 
passed an order on 29.06.2021 to the following effect: 
“Issue 
notice 
to 
the 
respondents 
returnable on 3rd August 2021. 
Our 
attention 
is 
invited 
to 
the 
photographs annexed as Annexures-Y to Y6.  
In view of the said photographs, at this stage, 
the appellant is entitled to a limited interim 
relief. Accordingly, we direct that only that part 
of the impugned order by which the appellant 
 
 
 
 
7 
 
 
has 
been 
prevented 
from 
raising 
the 
construction will remain stayed.” 
 
3. Appellant who is defendant No.1 before the 
Commercial Court has sought to contend that very 
application filed under Section 9 of the Arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996 was not maintainable. However, this 
has been seriously disputed by Sri Siddhart Yadav, learned 
Senior Counsel appearing for respondent Nos.1 to 16 and 
he would also contend that present appeal filed by first 
defendant itself is not maintainable.  This Court is of the 
considered view that any exercise undertaken to address 
these two issues is likely to prejudice the rights of parties 
and 
we 
say 
so 
for 
the 
simple 
reason 
that 
Com.AA.No.65/2021 filed by plaintiffs has not yet been 
disposed of or main matter is still pending. It is only 
interlocutory application which was filed along with main 
petition which has been disposed of and same is under 
challenge in the present appeal. The order of temporary 
injunction which came to be passed by the Commercial 
Court on 17.06.2021 was for the first time and a restraint 
 
 
 
 
8 
 
 
order has been passed against defendant Nos.1 and 2 
namely, appellant and respondent No.17 herein, though 
Com.AA.No.65/2021 was filed on 29.03.2021. In other 
words, there was no order of temporary injunction 
operating against appellant and respondent No.17 herein 
from 29.03.2021 till 17.06.2021. 
 
4.  Be that as it may. Without going into the 
contentions now raised, it would suffice to direct the 
Commercial Court to dispose of the main petition or main 
matter itself which is said to have been listed on 
30.08.2021 for final arguments. Hence, making it explicitly 
clear that order which came to be passed by this Court on 
29.06.2021 
would 
continue 
till 
disposal 
of 
Com.AA.No.65/2021 and Commercial Court without being 
influenced by the order dated 29.06.2021 and the order 
dated 17.06.2021, shall adjudicate the matter on merits 
and dispose of the main petition or main matter 
expeditiously and at any rate on or before 13.09.2021, 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
 
subject to both parties cooperating with the Commercial 
Court.   
 
5.  It is needless to state that if either of the parties 
were to seek for adjournment without any justifiable 
ground, the Commercial Court would not only be entitled 
to impose on such parties exemplary cost but also put 
them on terms as it deems fit to regulate its proceedings 
namely to conclude the proceedings within the time frame 
fixed by this Court.   
 
6.  It is also made clear that we have not expressed 
any 
opinion 
on 
merits 
namely, 
with 
regard 
to 
maintainability of the petition filed under Section 9 of the 
Arbitration 
and 
Conciliation 
Act, 
1996 
as 
well 
as 
maintainability of present appeal and contentions raised in 
that regard are kept open.   
Subject to aforesaid observation, this appeal stands 
disposed of.  
 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
In view of Commercial Appeal having been disposed 
of, 
IA.No.1/2021 
for 
stay 
does 
not 
survive 
for 
consideration and it stands consigned to record.
