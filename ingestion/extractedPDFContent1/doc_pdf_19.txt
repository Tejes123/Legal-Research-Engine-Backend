JUDGMENT
 
Heard 
Sri 
Anish 
Acharya, 
learned 
Advocate 
appearing for appellant and Sri Varun Vedachala, 
learned Advocate appearing for respondent-1.  Perused 
the records. 
 
2. 
Parties are referred to as per their rank in the 
commercial court. 
 
3. 
A suit came to be filed by the plaintiff against 
defendants for recovery of  sum of Rs.5.37.834/- with 
interest @ 18% p.a. from the date of suit till the date of 
payment which resulted in summons being issued to the 
defendants and defendant No.1 appeared in person on 
07.03.2020 and prayed for time to file written statement 
and it came to be granted.    Subsequently, suit was 
transferred to C.H.19 and thereafter to C.H.No.83 - 
Commercial Court by notification dated 17.08.2020.  
Subsequently, suit was withdrawn from C.H.No.83 and 
transferred to newly established Commercial Court by 
notification dated 22.12.2020.  When the matter was 
called for the first time before the Commercial Court, 
4
plaintiff filed Interlocutory Application for issuance of 
suit summons to defendants-1, 2 and 4 by substituted 
service namely, through paper publication.  Commercial 
Court, after noticing that first defendant was present 
before court on 07.03.2020 but had failed to engage a 
counsel or file a written statement, yet ordered for 
issuance of summons by substituted service.   
 
4. 
Once again, for the second time, first 
defendant was duly served that too, by way of paper 
publication but failed to appear and as such, he was 
placed exparte on 20.03.2021.  On 07.04.2021 first 
defendant filed I.A.No.2 for setting aside the same and 
sought time to file written statement.  Though 
Commercial Court, set aside the order placing first 
defendant exparte, time prayed for filing written 
statement came to be rejected by relying upon the 
judgment of Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of 
DESHRAJ 
vs 
BALIKISHAN 
(DEAD) 
THROUGH 
PROPOSED LEGAL REPRESENTATIVES reported in 
(2020)2 SCC 708.  Commercial Court also noticed that 
though first defendant had appeared personally before 
5
court on 07.03.2020 but had not chosen to file written 
statement within 120 days from the date of service of 
summons as provided under Order 8 Rule 1 CPC.   
 
5. 
It is thereafter applications - I.A.No.4 under 
Order 8 Rule 1 read with Section 151 CPC seeking recall 
of the order dated 07.04.2021 and I.A.No.5 under 
Section 5 of the Limitation Act to condone the delay in 
filing the written statement came to be filed.  Though in 
the affidavit supporting the applications, first defendant 
had contended that he has tested positive for COVID-19 
and was unable to give instructions to the counsel and 
as a result, there has been delay in filing the written 
statement, no piece of document had been produced 
before the Commercial Court or even before this court 
till date to evidence this fact.  In fact, there has been 
delay of more than one year in not filing the written 
statement.  In the prevalent situation namely, pandemic 
present through out the country, this court would have 
accepted the reason assigned by first defendant for 
condoning the delay but for the lapses on the part of 
first defendant and as such, on the basis of his self 
6
serving testimony, said reason assigned for delay in 
filing written statement cannot be accepted.   
 
6. 
In fact, it would not be out of context to refer 
at this juncture itself that first defendant having 
appeared before Commercial Court on 07.03.2020 and 
having sought for time to file written statement, 
thereafter did not appear at all, had perforced the 
Commercial Court to re-issue the summons to first 
defendant which also did not yield positive result.  Thus, 
left with no option, plaintiff had filed Interlocutory 
Application to serve summons through substituted 
service namely, through paper publication and only after 
notice through paper publication was taken out,  first 
defendant surfaced before the Commercial Court.  
Conduct of first defendant does not inspire confidence in 
this Court also that reason assigned by first defendant 
for non-appearance had to be accepted either by the 
Commercial Court or by this Court.  
 
7. 
Proceedings of the Commercial Court has 
been made available for perusal of this Court by learned 
7
Advocate appearing for plaintiff.  Perusal of the same 
would indicate that for filing of written statement by first 
defendant, matter has been adjourned to 07.03.2020 to 
12.06.2020 and thereafter to 26.06.2020.  As noticed 
herein above, by virtue of the notification dated 
17.08.2020, 
matter 
came 
to 
be 
transferred 
to 
Commercial Court and was listed before Commercial 
Court on 29.08.2020.  From 13.10.2020 to 08.12.2020, 
due to extant SOP  operating, there was closure of 
courts.  On 08.02.2021, first defendant did not appear.  
Hence, application filed for substituted service was 
allowed and on 20.03.2021, defendant Nos.1,2 and 4 
were placed exparte.  Though matter was listed on 
29.03.2021, none appeared on behalf of plaintiff also 
and on the subsequent dates i.e., 07.04.2021 Sri Anish 
Acharya, learned counsel filed vakalath on behalf of first 
defendant and filed an application for setting aside the 
order dated 20.03.2021 and same came to be allowed 
and time sought for filing written statement on behalf of 
first defendant came to be rejected on the ground that 
120 days prescribed under Order 8 Rule 1 CPC had 
8
lapsed.  On the same day, issues were framed and Case 
Management Hearing held and schedule for hearing was 
fixed. Subsequently from 27.05.2021 till 18.06.2021, 
matter came to be adjourned from time to time for fresh 
Case Management Hearing.  On 23.07.2021, learned 
counsel appearing for plaintiff and first defendant 
appeared on which date, the calendar of hearing was re-
scheduled. On the day when the matter was fixed for 
recording evidence of the parties, learned Advocate 
appearing for first defendant has filed affidavit evidence 
under Order 11 Rules 4 and 5 CPC.  On account of first 
defendant 
having 
not 
filed 
written 
statement, 
Commercial Court discarded the said affidavit evidence 
also.  In fact, there was no representation on behalf of 
plaintiff and third defendant in the post lunch session.   
On the next date i.e., on 05.08.2021, first defendant has 
filed an application to recall the order dated 07.04.2021 
as already noticed herein above.  
 
8. 
Learned 
Advocate 
appearing 
for 
first 
defendant has contended that a plea has been set up by 
first defendant in the written statement which was filed 
9
before Commercial Court to the effect that first 
defendant is liable to pay only Rs.67,000/- as against 
the claim of Rs.5,67,522/- made in the plaint at 
Rs.5,37,834/-.   
 
9. 
There being no dispute to the fact that 
provisions of CPC being applicable to the proceedings 
before Commercial Court, we are of the considered view 
that first defendant though had filed the application 
belatedly, in the light of defence set up in the written 
statement, it would be open to him to substantiate the 
same.  In fact, Commercial Court ought to have 
extended a last opportunity to cross examine the 
plaintiff's witness and this was also not done. Hence, we 
are of the considered view that an opportunity deserves 
to be granted to first defendant - appellant conditionally, 
on payment of costs of Rs.50,000/- payable to plaintiff - 
first respondent herein failing which, impugned order 
would automatically stand restored. 
 
Hence, we proceed to pass the following: 
ORDER 
(1) 
Commercial Appeal is allowed.
