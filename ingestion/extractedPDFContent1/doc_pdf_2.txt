THIS COMMERCIAL APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 
37 OF THE ARBITRATION AND CONCILIATION ACT, 1996 READ 
WITH SECTION 13(1A)  OF THE COMMERCIAL COURTS ACT, 
2015 PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER DATED 04.03.2021 
(ANNEXURE-A) PASSED BY THE COMMERCIAL COURT AND 
THE PRINCIPAL DISTRICT AND SESSIONS JUDGE AT KOLAR IN 
COMM. A.A. NO.2020, AND ETC.  
 
THIS 
COMMERCIAL 
APPEAL 
COMING 
ON 
FOR 
ADMISSION THROUGH VIDEO CONFERENCING THIS DAY, 
CHIEF JUSTICE DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 3 - 
JUDGMENT 
 
By consent, the appeal is taken up for final 
disposal.  By this appeal, the appellant has taken an 
exception to the judgment and order dated 4th March, 
2021 passed by the Principal District and Sessions 
Judge, Kolar by which a petition filed by the appellant 
herein under Section 9 of the Arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, "the Arbitration Act") 
has been dismissed as infructuous. 
 
2. 
In paragraph 6 of the impugned judgment and 
order, the learned Judge has referred to sub-section 
(2) of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act and has observed 
that it is mandatory that the arbitration proceedings 
shall commence within a period of ninety days from the 
date of grant of interim protection granted under sub-
section (1) of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act.  The 
learned Judge further proceeded to observe that the 
interim order directing the parties to maintain status 
quo was passed on 4th November, 2020 and therefore, 
 
 
 
 
- 4 - 
the period of ninety days expired on 2nd February, 
2021.  
 
3. 
It appears that the attention of the learned Judge 
was not invited to the fact that a petition under Section 
11 of the Arbitration Act was filed by the appellant 
herein in this Court which was allowed on 12th April, 
2021.  A copy of the said judgment and order is placed 
on record.  It is pertinent to note that in the said 
judgment, it is noted that a legal 
notice for 
appointment of an arbitrator was issued by the 
appellant on 17th October, 2020. This fact is not 
disputed.  This fact was not noticed by the learned 
Judge and that is how he erroneously invoked sub-
section (2) of Section 9 of the Arbitration Act for 
holding that the petition had become infructuous.  In 
the circumstances, the finding recorded by the learned 
Judge in paragraph 6 of the impugned judgment and 
order cannot be sustained. 
 
4. 
Hence, the appeal must succeed and we pass the 
following order: 
 
 
 
 
- 5 - 
ORDER 
 
(i) The impugned judgment and order dated 4th 
March, 2021 is hereby quashed and set aside and the 
petition bearing Com.A.A.No.2 of 2020 is restored to 
the file of the learned Principal District and Sessions 
Judge, Kolar; 
 
 
 
(ii) We direct the parties to appear before the 
Principal District and Sessions Judge, Kolar on 30th 
June, 2021; 
 
 
 
(iii) As the date has been fixed in the presence of 
the learned counsel for both the parties, it will not be 
necessary for the Court of the Principal District and 
Sessions Judge, Kolar to issue a notice to the parties; 
 
 
 
(iv) To enable the appellant to prosecute the 
petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act , the 
order of status quo passed on 4th November, 2020 is 
hereby extended till 7th July, 2021; 
 
 
 
(v) We make it clear that we have made no 
adjudication on the merits of the controversy and the 
learned Principal District and Sessions Judge, Kolar will 
 
 
 
 
- 6 - 
decide the petition filed under Section 9 of the 
Arbitration Act without being influenced by the 
continuation of the order of status quo by this Court; 
 
 
 
(vi) The appeal is partly allowed on the above 
terms.  Pending applications do not survive for 
consideration and the same stand disposed of.
