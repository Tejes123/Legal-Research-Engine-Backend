THIS APPEAL IS FILED UNDER SECTION 13 (IA) OF 
COMMERCIAL COURTS APPEAL R/W ORDER XLIII RULE 1 ( R ) 
OF THE CPC, PRAYING TO SET ASIDE THE ORDER DATED 
06/04/2021 PASSED ON I.A.NO.2 IN COM.O.S.NO.352/2020 
PASSED BY THE COURT OF LXXXIII ADDL.CITY CIVIL AND 
SESSIONS JUDGE (COMMERCIAL COURT) BENGALURU  AND 
ALLOW I.A NO.2 AS PRAYED FOR AND PASS FOR AND PASS 
SUCH OTHER AND FURTHER ORDERS AS DEEMED FIT IN THE 
FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES O THE CASE AND ETC., 
 
THESE APPEALS ARE COMING ON FOR ORDERS, THIS 
DAY, ARAVIND KUMAR J., DELIVERED THE FOLLOWING: 
 
 
 
 
 
JUDGMENT  
 
These two appeals are directed against the order 
dated 06.04.2021 passed in Commercial Suit No.352 of 
2020, wherein interlocutory applications IA Nos.1 and 2 
filed under order XXXVIII Rule 5 r/w 151 of CPC and                          
under order XXXIX Rules 1 & 2 r/w 151 of CPC 
respectively, which came to be allowed in part / dismissed.  
 
 
2. 
In IA No.1/2021 plaintiffs sought for an order 
for attachment against defendant No.2 in respect of 
schedule A & B properties and against defendant No.5 in 
respect of Schedule C property.  Whereas in IA No.2/2021 
an order of temporary injunction was sought by plaintiff to 
 
 
 
 
9 
 
 
restrain defendant No.2 from alienating or encumbering 
Schedule A and B Properties and to restrain defendant 
No.5 from alienating or encumbering Schedule C & D 
properties.  
 
 
3. 
Insofar as IA No.1/2021 is concerned, trial 
court by its order dated 06.04.2021 which is under 
challenge has allowed the same in part and directed the 
defendant to furnish security for Rs.7,69,36,876/- within 
one month from the date of order and on failure of the 
defendant No.2 to furnish the security within one month, 
Schedule B property has been ordered to be attached.  
Insofar as prayer for attachment of Schedule A property is 
concerned, same has been rejected.    
 
4. 
Plaintiff being aggrieved by non-granting of an 
order of attachment in respect of Schedule A property, is 
before this Court in ComAP No.71/2021. Whereas ComAP 
No. 84/2021 has been preferred by the plaintiff being 
aggrieved by the order of trial court rejecting the 
application for temporary injunction sought for against 
 
 
 
 
10 
 
 
defendant Nos.2 & 5 in respect of Schedule A and D 
properties.  
 
 
5. 
Learned counsel appearing for defendant No.2 
before the trial court, namely, Sri M.S. Venugopal, submits 
that defendant No.2 and his wife, who own Schedule B 
property would file an affidavit undertaking that they 
would not sell or encumber Schedule B property during the 
pendency of the suit.  He would also hasten to add that in 
respect of Schedule A property defendant No.2 also 
undertakes that he will not sell or encumber the same and 
an affidavit to the said effect would be filed within ten days 
from today.  He would also submit that in the light of the 
said undertaking given the order of attachment be 
modified. 
 
 
6. 
Sri 
Venkataramana.M.K., 
learned 
counsel 
appearing on behalf of respondent Nos.3 to 5 submits that 
defendant No.5 (respondent No.5) would undertake that 
insofar as Schedule C property is concerned, he owns only 
50% right, title and interest and to the said extent of 50% 
 
 
 
 
11 
 
 
of right in Schedule C property, he would undertake not to 
alienate or encumber the said property during the 
pendency of the suit.  He would submit that Schedule D 
property is mortgaged to Canara Bank.  He would further 
state that Schedule D property is exclusively owned by 
defendant No.5 (respondent No.5) and said property would 
not be sold or encumbered during the pendency of the suit 
and this undertaking is already given before the trial court.  
He would also submit that if any further encumbrance 
would be created, defendant No.5 would make necessary 
application before the trial court seeking such permission.  
 
 
7. 
We make it expressly clear that in the event 
such application is filed, trial court would be at liberty to 
consider the same after hearing both the parties and pass 
orders in accordance with law.  However, we make it clear 
that we are not expressing any opinion in that regard and 
contentions of both the parties are kept open.  
 
 
8. 
Learned counsel appearing for defendant No.5 
submits that an affidavit to the said effect shall be filed 
 
 
 
 
12 
 
 
within 10 days from today.  His submission is placed on 
record.   
 
 
9. 
In the light of the aforesaid facts and 
undertakings given by learned counsel appearing for 
respondent Nos.2 to 5, continuation of these appeals 
would not be warranted.  We further clarify that 
attachment order issued is modified to the extent of 
undertaking given by the defendant No.2 insofar as 
Schedule B property and same shall stand modified.   
 
 
 
10. 
Accordingly, these two appeals stands disposed 
of.  
 
We make it further clear that in the event of 
undertaking by way of an affidavit is not filed within ten 
(10) days from today, as undertaken before this Court, 
appellant will be at liberty to seek revival of these two 
appeals. 
 
 
 
 
 
13 
 
 
 
Trial court shall make all endeavor for expeditious 
disposal of the suit, subject to both parties co-operating 
with the trial court. 
 
 
All pending applications stands consigned to records.
