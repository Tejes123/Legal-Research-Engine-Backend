CONFERENCING THIS DAY, CHIEF JUSTICE MADE THE FOLLOWING: 
JUDGMENT
 
1.  Heard the learned counsel appearing for the appellant 
and the learned counsel appearing for the respondents. 
 
2.  By filing a petition under Section 9 of the Arbitration and 
Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short 'the said Act of 1996'), the 
petitioner invoked clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 9 of the 
said Act of 1996 seeking a direction to secure the amount in 
dispute in arbitration.   
 
3.  According to the case of the appellant, the amount in 
 
3 
dispute subject matter of arbitration is Rs.17,81,04,833/-.  The 
learned counsel appearing for the appellant fairly pointed out that 
after the impugned order was passed, the learned Arbitrator has 
been appointed and in fact, the appellant has moved an 
application for interim directions under Section 17 of the said Act 
of 1996.  He states that the said application is not being heard.   
 
4.  The learned counsel appearing for the respondents, on 
instructions, states that the respondents will deposit a sum of 
Rs.8,95,00,000/- (Rupees Eight crores ninety five lakhs) with the 
Arbitral Tribunal within a period of three weeks from today.   
 
5.  The learned counsel appearing for the appellant states 
that if the said amount is deposited, the appellant will not press for 
an order securing the remaining amount. However, he states that 
he will seek the relief in respect of the entire amount under 
Section 17 of the said Act 1996. 
 
6.  As the respondents has agreed to deposit a sum of 
Rs.8,95,00,000/- (Rupees Eight crores ninety five lakhs) within 
three weeks from today, till the date of deposit of the amount, the 
 
4 
interim relief operating till date will have to continue.  On deposit 
of the said amount within three weeks from today, the interim 
relief shall automatically cease to operate.  However, if the 
amount is not deposited, it follows that the interim relief will 
continue till the decision on the application is made under Section 
17 of the said Act of 1996.  
 
7.  In view of the above discussion, we pass the following: 
ORDER
i)     We accept the statement made by the learned counsel 
appearing 
for 
the 
respondents 
that 
a 
sum 
of 
Rs.8,95,00,000/- (Rupees Eight crores ninety five lakhs) 
will be deposited with the Arbitral Tribunal/Arbitration
Center within a period of three weeks from today; 
ii)     We direct that the interim relief which is operating till 
today shall continue to operate for a period of three 
weeks from today; 
 
5 
iii)     If 
the 
respondents 
deposit 
the 
amount 
of 
Rs.8,95,00,000/- (Rupees Eight crores ninety five lakhs) 
with intimation to the appellant within a period of three 
weeks from today, on deposit of the said amount, the 
interim relief shall stand vacated without further 
reference to the Court; 
iv)     On the failure of the respondents to deposit a sum of 
Rs.8,95,00,000/- (Rupees Eight crores ninety five lakhs) 
within a period of three weeks from today, the interim 
relief operating in this appeal shall continue to operate till 
the disposal of the application made by the appellant 
under Section 17 of the said Act of 1996; 
v)     We make it clear that notwithstanding this order, it will be 
always open for the appellant to prosecute the 
application made under Section 17 of the said Act 1996 
for securing the entire amount of Rs.17,81,04,833/-.  
However, all the defences of the respondents are kept 
open; 
vi)     The appeal is disposed of on the above terms. 
 
6 
vii)     On deposit of the amount by the respondents, the same 
shall be forthwith suitably invested in Fixed Deposit.
